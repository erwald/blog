# How to Get Hold of a Research Paper

Here are some ways of acquiring the full text of an academic paper:

1. Search [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.se/). Give it the DOI (e.g. `https://doi.org/...`) or, if that doesn't work, give it the URL to the paper's page at an academic journal (e.g. `https://www.sciencedirect.com/science...`).
2. Search [Libgen](https://www.libgen.is/scimag/). Give it the DOI or title. (You can also use Libgen to find [academic books](https://www.libgen.is/).)
3. Search [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/). I often just search the paper's name, and if I find it, there may be a link to the full paper (HTML or PDF) on the right of the search result. The linked paper is sometimes not the exact version of the paper I am after -- for example, it may be a manuscript version instead of the accepted journal version -- but in my experience this is usually fine.
4. Search the web for `"name of paper in quotes" filetype:pdf`. If that fails, search for `"name of paper in quotes"` and look at a few of the results if they seem promising. (Again, I may find a different version of the paper than the one I was looking for, which is usually but not always fine.)
5. Check the paper's authors' personal websites for the paper. Many researchers keep an up-to-date list of their papers with links to full versions.
6. Request the paper on [r/Scholar](https://old.reddit.com/r/Scholar/). Make sure to read the posting rules first.
7. Email an author to politely ask for a copy. Researchers spend a lot of time on their research and are usually happy to learn that somebody is eager to read it.

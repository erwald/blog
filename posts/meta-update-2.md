It has now been a year (on the day) since I published my [introductory post]({{ '/posts/introduction/' | url }}). A hearty thanks to those of you who have come, stuck it out or left and returned.

I have published 63 posts so far, amounting to over 105,000 words, though the pace has slowed to about one post per week ever since I started working full-time just over three months ago. I have written some good ones and some not so good ones. Here are the ten most widely viewed posts:

1.  [The American Style of Quotation Mark Punctuation Makes No Sense]({{ '/posts/the-american-style-of-quotation-mark-punctuation-makes-no-sense/' | url }})
2.  [Setting Up Gmail in Doom Emacs using mbsync and mu4e]({{ '/posts/setting-up-gmail-in-doom-emacs-using-mbsync-and-mu4e/' | url }})
3.  [Can a Vegan Diet Be Healthy? A Literature Review]({{ '/posts/can-a-vegan-diet-be-healthy-a-literature-review/' | url }})
4.  [Using Scheme to Find the Median of Two Sorted Integer Lists]({{ '/posts/using-scheme-to-find-the-median-of-two-sorted-integer-lists/' | url }})
5.  [Four Ways of Not Writing Software Bugs]({{ '/posts/four-ways-of-not-writing-software-bugs/' | url }})
6.  [Utilitarianism Expressed in Julia]({{ '/posts/utilitarianism-expressed-in-julia/' | url }})
7.  [Animal Testing Is Exploitative and Largely Ineffective]({{ '/posts/animal-testing-is-exploitative-and-largely-ineffective/' | url }})
8.  [Does It Smell like Pollocks in Here?]({{ '/posts/does-it-smell-like-pollocks-in-here/' | url }})
9.  [Interview with Christine M. Korsgaard: Animal Ethics, Kantianism, Utilitarianism]({{ '/posts/interview-with-christine-m-korsgaard-animal-ethics-kantianism-utilitarianism/' | url }})
10. [The Devastating Power and Heartbreaking Pain of Truly Changing Minds]({{ '/posts/the-devastating-power-and-heartbreaking-pain-of-truly-changing-minds/' | url }})

It is no coincidence that fully half (if you count the first one) of these have to do with programming. That is because of Hacker News. Six of them (1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7) reached the Hacker News front page; three of those (1, 3 and 7) spent time in the top slot. These were not necessarily my strongest posts; I just don't have any good avenues for sharing the non-tech-related posts with large, enthusiastic and potentially interested audiences.

I think [The Devastating Power and Heartbreaking Pain of Truly Changing Minds]({{ '/posts/the-devastating-power-and-heartbreaking-pain-of-truly-changing-minds/' | url }}) is the finest post I have written so far. It's pretty long; I wrote it over a one-week holiday in October. It is about apostasy in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and what Julia Galef calls **scout mindset**. I think it is factually sound, well-written and important and recommend reading it.

I also made four interviews with really talented people: the Kantian philosopher [Christine M. Korsgaard](https://www.erichgrunewald.com/posts/interview-with-christine-m-korsgaard-animal-ethics-kantianism-utilitarianism/), the effective altruist [Lucia Coulter](https://www.erichgrunewald.com/posts/interview-with-lucia-coulter-lead-exposure-effective-altruism-progress-in-malawi/), the futurologist [Olle Häggström](https://www.erichgrunewald.com/posts/interview-with-olle-haggstrom-reason-covid-19-and-academic-freedom-in-sweden/) and the composer [Corentin Boissier]({{ '/posts/interview-with-corentin-boissier-romanticism-modernism-composition/' | url }}). Together, they'd make quite the posse. I haven't had time to do any more during the fall, but look forward to doing so again in future.

Among the less widely read posts, I wrote a few good ones that haven't received the audience that in my opinion they deserve:

- [Networks of Meaning]({{ '/posts/networks-of-meaning/' | url }}) argues, paraphrasing Gerald Murnane, that meaning is connection, that a thing has meaning if it's connected with another thing, and dives into some related research from psychology;
- [How Can One Tell What Is Beautiful?]({{ '/posts/how-can-one-tell-what-is-beautiful/' | url }}) asks whether art is subjective or objective, or both, or neither;
- [Mysteries of the Unknown and the Unknowable]({{ '/posts/mysteries-of-the-unknown-the-unknowable/' | url }}) makes a distinction between two kinds of mystery – the one of Arthur Conan Doyle and the one of Teresa of Ávila – and argues that H. P. Lovecraft's _The Call of Cthulhu_ draws its power from both kinds; and
- [Moral Standing Is Not Moral Agency]({{ '/posts/moral-standing-is-not-moral-agency/' | url }}) makes another distinction, this one moral, that people often fail to observe, especially when it comes to debates about animal ethics.

Okay, enough congratulations. I also wrote some posts that I think were pretty weak. [A Contradiction at the Heart of Stallman's Free Software Argument](https://www.erichgrunewald.com/posts/a-contradiction-at-the-heart-of-stallman's-free-software-argument/) did not make sufficiently clear that Richard Stallman's position isn't necessarily self-contradictory if utilitarianism is true. [The AstraZeneca Vaccine Will Save Lives](https://www.erichgrunewald.com/posts/the-astra-zeneca-vaccine-will-save-lives/) was fundamentally sound but made one very bad prediction. [The Kingdom of Tamego](https://www.erichgrunewald.com/posts/the-kingdom-of-tamego/) was a work of fiction, a kind of fable which didn't really find an audience. [It Did Not Take Matt Bruenig and Jon White Two Days to Make a Good Child Tax Credit Website](https://www.erichgrunewald.com/posts/it-did-not-take-matt-bruenig-and-jon-white-two-days-to-make-a-good-child-tax-credit-website/) is perhaps a little bit pedantic and combative. A couple of posts on politics, [Permanent Suspension of Reason](https://www.erichgrunewald.com/posts/permanent-suspension-of-reason/) and [Everybody Is Vulnerable, Nobody Is Powerful]({{ '/posts/everybody-is-vulnerable-nobody-is-powerful/' | url }}), were not bad or untrue, I think, but pretty much superfluous; Freddie deBoer [does it better](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/), anyway.

So, one year. I am celebrating this anniversary with a new sidebar image (don't be confused if you don't see a sidebar – there isn't one on mobile), a painting, of which I am the happy owner, taken from an [NFT collection](https://opensea.io/collection/buoyant) created by my wife:

![Painting of floating island with mushrooms by Viktoriia Shcherbak.]({{ '/img/mushrooms.jpeg' | url }})

It replaces the painting by Auguste Louis Lepère, which served me well over the past year. That's all for now. Here's to a 2022 with lots of time and quiet for reading and writing!

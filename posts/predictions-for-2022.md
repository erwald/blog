# Predictions for 2022

ME: You journalists have your fingers on the pulse of time. Say, what does the new year hold for us?

JOURNALIST: It's impossible to tell. Nothing is certain.

ME: Surely some things are as good as certain.

JOURNALIST: Well, of course. The imminent repeal of Roe v. Wade – that's certain. And a catastrophic defeat for the Democrats in next year's midterm elections – that's certain, too.

ME: Nothing from the world outside the States?

JOURNALIST: That's murkier.

ME: Anything else?

JOURNALIST: Nothing apart from the continuing degradation of life on planet earth due to cataclysmic climate change.

ME: I admire your willingness to stake your reputation in falsifiable prediction-making.

JOURNALIST: The key is to have a journalistic frame of mind. Verifying your sources, checking your facts, doing your homework – that's what it's all about. Being able to see things from different points of view. Of course, we don't really believe in that stuff about journalistic objectivity anymore. Everybody knows that nobody is perfectly objective, ergo everybody is equally biased and there's no point even trying. But that's a good thing – nobody can expect us to be right if we can't say what we really feel. Besides, journalists are on average far more conscientious and informed than the regular person – I think I heard that somewhere ...

ME: I admire your ability to introspect, too. Being an amateur writer, I am no match for you as a forecaster, but I do sometimes try to foretell the future. In fact, I have my own predictions for the year to come ...

## Section 6: Forecasting

In 2022,

1. These predictions will have been perfectly [calibrated](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/calibration)[^1]. ⇒ 100%

[^1]:
    What my joke predictions have illustrated is a well-known limitation of the calibration metric. I think Julia Galef discusses it in _Scout Mindset_, and I know Philip E. Tetlock discusses it in _Superforecasting_. It does not mean calibration is not a useful metric; it only means that, being an aggregate measure, it doesn't give the full picture. It only describes how well our predicted probabilities match the actual frequencies of outcomes. From the point of view of calibration, my astronomy predictions look perfect, but of course better predictions for those questions would have been something like 100% certainty that the moon will wax and wane and 100% certainty that the sun will _not_ rise in the west and set in the east. That is because calibration does not care how confident one is in one's predictions.

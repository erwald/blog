## Style Guide

- Use italics for emphasis, titles of works and terms and phrases in non-English languages.
- Use bold (styled as underlined) for key terms and phrases.
- Use quotation marks for titles of brief works, like book chapters, articles, short stories, short poems, songs and – god forbid – radio or TV episodes.
- Explanatory or clarifying sentences and phrases may be put in parentheses and italics.
- Code snippets and anything that might appear in code or in a terminal may be put in code tags.
- Spell out cardinal and ordinal numbers under 11.
- For titles, use these rules based on the APA guidelines:
  - Capitalise the first word
  - Capitalise the first word after any sort of strong punctuation (period, colon, semicolon, en-dash)
  - Capitalise nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs and pronouns
  - Capitalise the second part of hyphenated major words
  - Do not capitalize articles, conjunctions, and prepositions of any length
  - Do not capitalize the second part of a Latin species name
